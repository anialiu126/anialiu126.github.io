Welcome to my webpage! I'm Anna Liu (刘安娜), but my friends call me Ania, the Polish familiar form of my name. I am half-Polish half-Chinese. I am an incoming postdoctoral researcher at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) from fall 2025. 

I finished my PhD in Gravitational-Wave (GW) Physics at the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) in June 2025, specialising in gravitational-wave data analysis of compact binary signals. I developed a phenomenological GW lensing model and have contributed to ringdown analyses of GWs. I am a member of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration, contributing to the Testing General Relativity and Lensing Groups.
