Welcome to my webpage! I'm Anna Liu (刘安娜), but you can call me Ania, the Polish familiar form of my name. I am half-Polish half-Chinese, and I am currently pursuing a PhD in Gravitational-Wave Physics at the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK). I am a member of the [Gravitational-Wave Group at CUHK](https://gw.phy.cuhk.edu.hk/), and a member of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration.
