Growing up in both Polish and Chinese cultures, I am a native speaker of both languages. 
I attended primary school in China and Poland on a two-month rotation, successfully completing both programs.

For my undergraduate studies, I attended the University of Oxford, followed by a masterâ€™s program at KU Leuven in Belgium. Currently, I am completing my PhD at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.

My multicultural background has taught me to adapt my communication approach to diverse contexts. 
During a gap year after my BA, I worked as a freelance translator and interpreter (Polish-Chinese-English), translating cultural texts and film scripts and interpreting for Polish representatives at Polish-Chinese diplomatic and business meetings. 
This experience deepened my understanding of the importance of clear communication in international teams, where even the best science can be diminished without a compelling presentation.
This background has strengthened my ability to bridge disciplines and cultures, an asset I bring to collaborative research.
