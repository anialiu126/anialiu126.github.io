Growing up in Polish and Chinese environments, I am a native speaker of both languages. 
I attended primary school in China and in Poland on a two-month rotation and successfully completed both programmes. 

I pursued my undergraduate studies at the University of Oxford, followed by a master's programme at KU Leuven in Belgium.
Currently, I am completing my PhD at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. 

My multicultural experiences have taught me to adapt communication tools to various contexts. 
I deeply understand the importance of communication, especially in international teams, recognizing that even the best science can be lost without a clear and compelling presentation.
