I attended the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) Collaboration Meeting in Toyama, Japan, which was an inspiring experience. Presenting my poster on gravitational wave lensing sparked meaningful discussions and gave me valuable insights to refine my research. Visiting the KAGRA detector was a highlightâ€”seeing its advanced underground setup and learning about its cryogenic technology was fascinating. This trip deepened my appreciation for the engineering behind gravitational wave detections and the collaborative effort driving the field forward.
