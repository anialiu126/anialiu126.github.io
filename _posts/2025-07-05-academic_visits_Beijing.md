I recently spent some time in Beijing visiting several gravitational-wave groups â€” at Beijing Normal University, Tsinghua University, 
Peking University, and the National Astronomical Observatory of the Chinese Academy of Sciences ðŸŒŒ 
It was a great opportunity to dive into their latest research, exchange ideas, share some of my own work, 
and enjoy the beautiful campuses ðŸŒ¿âœ¨
