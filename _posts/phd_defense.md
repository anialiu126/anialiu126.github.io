Itâ€™s been a long, challenging, but also incredibly rewarding journey.
I couldnâ€™t have made it to the final chapter without the kindness, encouragement, and support of so many amazing people âœ¨


Huge thanks to my fellow group members of the [GW group at CUHK](https://gw.phy.cuhk.edu.hk/people/), who have become my academic family over the past 4 years. 
I am also grateful to my committee members â€” Prof. Paul Lasky, Prof. Ming Chung Chu, and Prof. Kenny Ng â€” as well as my supervisors, 
Prof. Tjonnie Li and Prof. Otto Hannuksela, for their guidance and support during this key milestone of my PhD journey.

Now onto the next adventure!ðŸš€
