Since the groundbreaking detection of gravitational waves on September 14, 2015, the field of gravitational wave physics has rapidly evolved. With about 100 signals observed as of the third observing run and new detectors on the horizon, the demand for refined theoretical models has never been greater. 
This study explores quartic-order corrections to gravitational waveforms derived from higher-curvature gravity, providing insights that are compatible with general relativity and testable through gravitatinoal-wave detections.


In this study, I derived quartic-order corrections to gravitational waveforms stemming from higher-curvature gravity. 
By adding higher-curvature terms to the Einstein-Hilbert action, I derived the corresponding correction terms and translated into characteristic parameters describing a gravitational wave signal.
I implemented the inspiral and ringdown corrections to a gravitational-waveform model.
The constructed prototype waveform model allows for initial tests with observed data.
